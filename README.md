# Food Finder

This project is a simple food ordering system implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to select food items from a drop-down menu and add them to a list of ordered items. The system keeps track of the total price and limits the number of items that can be ordered to five.

## Installation and Usage

To use this system, simply download the `index.html`, `index.css`, and `script.js` files and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The HTML file contains the necessary HTML elements to display the menu, the list of ordered items, and the buttons, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your own web page and customize the layout and styling as needed.
